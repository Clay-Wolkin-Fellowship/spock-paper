\section{Analysis}

We chose sp_omp because it showed an interesting distribution of Memory Accesses to Recache (MATR).
	We have plotted several cache replacemant algorithms against Belady's Optimal Algorithm.
	As you can see all cache algorithms have a lot of replacements under 100 K memory accesses from eviction.
	However, there are 3 peaks 250 K, 300 K, and 350 K memory accesses, with similar peaks in the other replacement algorithms.
	As expected MRU quickly recaches most of the evicted data.
	More interesting is that SRRIP, LRU, and FIFO, have shifted the peak slightly earlier, meaning that they cache the results slightly longer than possible.
	Meanwhile, RAND and NRU_RAND spread out the peak more, which is expected given the inherent randomness in each of the algorthims.
	DRRIP and BRRIP managed to determine roughly half the time that some of the lines are not going to be used for a long time and release them.
	This shows the ability have DRRIP and BRRIP to determine quickly which memory locations are not going to be used in a long time,
		this is advantageous because it frees up cache lines for data which would be used sooner.
