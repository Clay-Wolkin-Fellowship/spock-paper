\begin{abstract}
The effectiveness of caching policies has been measured by a number of metrics. 
The ultimate quantitative measure is overall system performance.
Other metrics such as hit rate, misses per thousand instructions and
instructions per cycle are also regularly used in the literature to
compare cache behaviors.
In this work we propose a novel class of metrics based on the idea
that the any memory element should ideally be kept out of the cache
for as long as possible before it needs to be fetched again.
Among this set of metrics, we analyze Memory Access To Recache as a
reasonably accessible number to collect through simulation that
approximates the ideal of Wall-Time To Recache close enough to be
interesting.
We also provide our simulation and testing methodology and source to
hopefully assist others in applying these metrics to their own
studies.
